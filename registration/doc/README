These are quick and simple instructions on how to install and use this app.


You will need to create an anonymous account.  Do this by
creating a normal user account with just permissions to the
registration app.  Or, you can use the same user as for Sitemgr, and
add permissions to registration app.

Login as admin user, go to the Administration menu, click on the
Site Configuration link for the registration application. Insert the
anonymous user and password, and fill in the other fields as desired.

You can customize what input the user is asked to enter by selecting the
'Registration fields'.  Some fields are required (name, email) so you cannot
choose them from the list.

Make sure phpgwapi.send is properly configured, i.e. the database
contains something like:

INSERT INTO egw_config VALUES ('phpgwapi','smtp_server','localhost');

Registration also has a sitemgr module which allows for more customization.
You can create a page as you want it, and point the login module's link to it.

After the user enters their information, a confirmation link will be emailed to them.
If they click on the link before it expires, the registration is completed.  
If a confirmation link expires, the user's information is purged.

Developers:
-----------
Registration supports a 'registration' hook, so you can register for other
things / apps using the same process.  The hook should return an array with the 
keys 'name', 'pre_check' and 'post_confirm_hook'.  It is also acceptable to return
an array with several name/pre_check/post_confirm_hook sub-arrays for multiple options
per application.

Name should be an un-translated [human] reference.  
pre_check and post_confirm_hook should be methods in the standard ExecMethod style.
pre_check is optional, and will be called with the data about to be saved.  It should return
true or an error message.
post_confirm_hook does not need to return anything, and is called after the confirmation is 
completed.
